[[The Machine]] is a deep underground contruct that keeps all machines connected. It generates energy at a nuclear level. It's underwater and maintained by sacrifices of man. 

When it requires maintenance, a person of faith is given the instructions to how to fix it and told to go below water to fix it. They are then sunken below irradiated water with enough oxygen to fix the problem and return. Noone has survived maintaining the machine.
