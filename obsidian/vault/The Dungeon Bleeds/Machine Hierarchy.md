The hierarchy looks something like this

TOP 
[[The Machine]]
[[The Archives]]

MIDDLE
[[Sect of the Machine]]

BOTTOM
High Priest
Priests and Lawkeepers
Worker ~ common
Worker ~ wageslave

Each sector of power has their own rules and regulations, and sometimes there are changes to this hierarchy. 

The top class has power over all other sectors, and often add, remove or change rules over these sectors. They can disolve or append sectors and even change legislations. 

The middle class has no power over other sectors unless apointed. The [[Flesh of the Machine]] cannot demand anything from any worker or any other [[Sect of the Machine]]  however, the [[Voice of the Machine]] sect can; as they can control the whorship of the machine on an individual or collective level. 

The bottom class has no power and no authority over higher classes. They do however have authority over each other. Such as High Priests having power of Priests and Lawbringers, and them having power of common workers.
